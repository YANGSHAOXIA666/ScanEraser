# ScanEraser: Lightweight Neural Networks for On-device Handwriting Erasure
The ScanEraser architecture consists of two fundamental components: a macrofield cleaner and a microfield refiner. The macrofield cleaner implements a mask-based handwriting removal mechanism with explicit erasure guidance. A feature-grabbing block enhances the capture
of contextual features around handwritten text. The network is compact and efficient, trained using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The microfield refiner employs a progressive refinement network with constrained receptive fields to repair detailed textures that the
macrofield cleaner cannot address adequately.
